# CLUSTERING
analyzing the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by  âˆ¼ 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09). Based on this analysis, I develop a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year and this, from its first purchase.
